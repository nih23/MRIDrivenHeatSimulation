1.0.0 (12/11/2013)
        - Initial version

2.0.0 (07/04/2014)
        - Removed function pointers for initialisation of data fields
          from parameter list of class ScaFES::Problem.
        - Removed function pointers for the analytical solutions
          from parameter list of class ScaFES::Problem.
        - Added std::vector<bool> computeError as parameter to
          constructor of ScaFES::Problem.
        - Added parameter bool const& useLeapFrog to the parameter list of
          the class ScaFES::Problem for setting if the leap frog scheme
          should be applied (=true) or not (=false).
        - Added parameter std::vector<bool> writeToFile to
          constructor of class ScaFES::Problem.
        - Added parameter std::vector<int> const& nLayers constructor
          of class ScaFES::Problem. Remark: Currently, nLayers has no effect.
        - Added "std::vector<CT> const& defaultValue" to parameter list of
          constructor of class ScaFES::Problem in order to initialise each
          field with a default value.
        - If the leap frog scheme should be applied, then the methods
            updateInner2(),
            updaterBorder2()
          must be implemented in the sub class.
        - Added checks for equal lengths of parameters in class ScaFES::Problem.
        - Removed methods writeFree() and readFree() for types ScaFES::Complex
          and ScaFES::Ntuple.
        - Removed writes of each field separately.
          Instead, all data fields (which are marked as unknown ones) will
          be written to one NetCDF file.
        - Added an enum class ScaFES::WriteHowOften in order to control how
          often a field should be written to the NetCDF file.
        - Fields which should be never written, are omitted in the NetCDF file.
        - NetCDF file will be written if at at least one field should be
          written.
        - Removed suffix "_All" from NetCDF file name.
        - Added ADOL-C support to initialisation and update phase.
        - Added command line parameter --writeKindFile=<0/1> (default=0).
        - Added command line option --nLayersAtBorder=<val> (default=1) such
          that the global border width can be flexible adjusted
          (for PMLs, e.g.).
        - Added command line option "--computeGradients=<0/1>" (default=0)
        - Added command line option --isTfTimeDependent=<0/1> (default=0).
        - Added command line option --checkGradients=<0/1> (default=0).
        - Added command line option --asynchronMode=<0/1> (default=1)
          in order to use synchroneous resp. asynchronous MPI communication.
        - Classes which are derived from the class ScaFES::Problem have to
          implement the methods ("Inner" = All global inner grid nodes,
          "Border" = All global border grid nodes):
            evaluate()   ---> evalInner(),
                              evalBorder(),
            initialise() ---> initInner(),
                              initBorder(),
            update2()    ---> updateInner2(),
                              updateBorder2(),
        - Removed internal class ScaFES::DataField::Iterator.
        - Added method DataField::time() returning the current time.
        - Extended class ScaFES::DataField such that it can represent matrices,
          too.
        - Internal memory management is reorganized: Memory will
          be not allocated anymore separately for each field in the class
          DataField, but in the class Problem. This results in one single
          memory lump for the new resp. for the old iterate.
        - Replaced calls to "new CT" by calls to "std::vector<CT>".

2.0.1 (09/25/2014)
        - Improved build and installation tests.
        - Updated doxygen documentation.
        - Fixed minor bugs wrt. build and installation process.

2.1.0 (11/13/2014)
        - Fixed bug related to enabling / disabling optional modules
          like ADOL-C or NetCDF. Before, software could only be built
          in the configuration which was used during the creation of the
          release.
        - Fixed VampirTrace MPI support.
        - Replaced compression format of html dir: tar.gz --> zip.
        - Removed inheritance of GridGlobal<DIM> from class Grid<DIM>.
          Instead, add discretized computational (global) domain as
          member variable to the class GridGlobal.
          Replaced corresponding calls to grid global related methods:
          globalGrid().... ----> globalGrid().discreteDomain()....
        - Added a new method for partitioning the discretized computational
          domain: Domain will be partitioned uniformly in each dimension.
          Added new command line options for the domain decomposition types:
            --typeDomainDecompostion=<UNI/RCB> (default=RCB).
              UNI: uniform domain decomposition
              RCB: domain decomposition using the RCB algorithm.
            --nPartitions=<p1x...xpd>, only in combination with "UNI"
              (default =nProcsMpix1x...x1).
              Number of partitions in each direction.
        - Created class ScaFES::Communicator in order to hide Boost.MPI.
        - Created class ScaFES::Timer for hiding boost::mpi::timer.
        - Added mode "DEBUG_MPI" to shell script executeScafesApplication.sh.
        - Renamed MPI related methods and moved those methods to the
          file ScaFES_Communicator.hpp.

2.2.0 (11/20/2014)
        - Created shell script scripts/scafescc.sh in order to simplify the
          build process of a ScaFES application. Necessary parameters for
          building the application can be configured via environment variables
          which are prefixed by "SCAFESCC_".
        - Created shell script scripts/scafesrun.sh (previously named
          scripts/executeScafesApplication.sh) in order to run a ScaFES
          application. Analogously to scafescc.sh, necessary parameters for
          running the application can be configured via environment variables
          which are prefixed by "SCAFESRUN_".
        - Removed warnings wrt. unused parameters (-Wunused) by applying
          the C++11 feature std::ignore = var; of <tuple>.
        - Fixed some minor bugs.

2.3.0 (05/27/2015)
        - Improved description of build and installation process.
        - Added description how to install ScaFES using shell scripts prefixed by
          scafes*.
        - Made build system file compatible to automake 1.14 AND automake < 1.14
        - Reset --enable-dist=yes as default.
        - Improved doxygen documentation.
        - Added page "FAQ" to doxygen documentation.
        - Replaced initialiser list of unordered map "mNCErrorStrings" in order
          to be compile applications using ICC 2013.
        - Added input files for test matrix shell scripts TESTMATRIX_RUN.sh:
          Paths within scripts will be created dynamically.
        - Fixed "define HAVE_MPI".
        - Added new class "ScaFES::Environment".
        - Add run modes "OPENMP_ONLY", "SERIAL", "LOADLEVELER_WITH_LLSUBMIT_CALL"
          to shell script scafesrun.sh
        - Added ifdef sections wrt. BOOST, BOOST_SERIALIZATION.
        - Changed configure checks: Now, Boost.program_options, Boost.Regex will
          be checked only if Boost is wanted.
        - Set default values for command line parameters if
          Boost.program_options is not enabled.
        - Fixed bug such that wall clock times will be correctly printed for
          OpenMP parallel ScaFES applications.
        - Wall clock times will be determined using gettimeofday() for serial
          ScaFES applications.
        - Fixed compile errors shown by clang 3.7-nightlybuild.
        - Corrected usage of "netcdf_par" depending on the availability of
          parallel NetCDF and MPI in ScaFES_DataFile.hpp, ScaFES_DataFileApi.hpp.
        - Renamed folder "scafes" to "src".

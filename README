            ScaFES: Scalable Framework for Explicit Solvers
            ===============================================

"We present ScaFES, an open-source HPC framework written in C++11 for
solving initial boundary value problems using explicit numerical methods
in time on structured grids. It is designed to be highly-scalable and
very user-friendly, i.e. to exploit all levels of parallelism and provide
easy-to-use interfaces. Besides, the numerical nomenclature is reflected
in a nearly one-to-one mapping."

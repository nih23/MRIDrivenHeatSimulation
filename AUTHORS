Martin Stoeckl (TU Dresden, Student) <martin.stoeckl AT mailbox.tu-dresden.de>
    * src/ScaFES_Problem.hpp: Added method initDfsFromFile() initializing
      known and unknown data fields from a NetCDF file.
    * src/ScaFES_Problem.hpp: Updated NetCDF write functions such that
      this method will only be called if values are written to file.
    * src/ScaFES_Problem.hpp: Fixed bug related to template parameter float.
    * src/ScaFES_DataField.hpp: Added method checkConv() in order
      to calculate convergence for data fields in each iteration step.
    * ScaFES_DataFile.hpp: Added case AT_END to ScaFES::WriteHowOften.
      in order to write NetCDF file only at the last timestep.
-   * src/ScaFES_Problem.hpp: Fixed bug in case only one unknown
      data field and no known data field are used.
        - src/ScaFES_Parameters.hpp: Added the following command line options:
            --initfile=<string>
              Sets the name of the initialization file.
            --initKnownDfs=<0/1>
              Sets if known data fields should be initialized from a NetCDF file.
            --threshold=<double>
              Sets the threshold for convergence check.
            --checkConvFirstAtIter=<int>
              Sets the number of iteration when convergence should
              be checked for the first time.
            --checkConvAtEveryNIter=<int>
              Sets the number of iterations between two convergence checks.
    * scripts/scafesrun.sh: Added the following SCAFESRUN environment
      variables:
            - SCAFESRUN_NAME_INITFILE=<string> (default="")
              Name of the initialization file / NetCDF file
            - SCAFESRUN_INIT_KNOWNDFS=<yes/no> (default="NO")
              Should known datafields be initialized from the init file?.
            - SCAFESRUN_THRESHOLD=<double> (default=1e-5)
              Threshold for convergence check
            - SCAFESRUN_CHECK_CONV_FIRST_AT_ITER=<int> (default=1)
              Number of iteration when convergence should be checked
              for the first time.
            - SCAFESRUN_CHECK_CONV_AT_EVERY_N_ITER=<int> (default=1)
              Number of iterations between two convergence checks.
            - SCAFESRUN_NAME_RESULTFILE=<string>
              Name of the result file / NetCDF file
    * src/ScaFES_DataFileApi.hpp: Added methods for reading in data fields
      from a file using NetCDF functions.
      This initialization works in serial and in parallel.
    * src/ScaFES_DataFileApi.hpp: Fixed bug related to inclusion
      of headers for parallel NetCDF.
